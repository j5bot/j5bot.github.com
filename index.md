# Jonathan 'J5' Cook

**Getting To Know Me, Getting to Learn All About Me**

## Introduction

-->

_I like patterns; taking abstract ideas and bringing them into the world of the
'real' in order to help people get more done and have more fun._

_I have taken on diverse roles and responsibilities throughout my career.  From individual contributor to systems architect, deputy CDO, mentor, people manager; back end; front end; system administration; ux designer and collaborator._

_Wondering about my nickname?  I <3 JS: so much so that my nickname, J5, is both a reference to the 80's movie
Short Circuit's Johnny 5 robot-with-emotions and to the tongue-in-cheek h4x0r spelling of
JS._

## What I'm looking for

I am seeking a Principal Software Engineer or Tech Lead position. For the right company, that will support me in furthering my career, I am happy to take a Senior Developer role while I learn your business.

My ideal company is past the early startup stage, with developed processes, strong leadership, and a clear strategy and long term vision.

I am a big believer in agile methodologies and iterative delivery, offering both the opportunity to fail quickly, the motivation to succeed, and the incentive to constantly strive for quality code.

The ideal culture for me is one where everyone — particularly leadership, product owners, and managers — is heavily invested in the success of the company, the quality of their work, and personal growth.  But also one where work/life balance is emphasized and tight deadlines don't translate into a high pressure, high stress environment or death marches.

I strongly prefer to work remotely, but am able to make myself available for on-site meetings as long as they are near my home in Fairfax, VA (greater Washington, DC area).

Basically, I've been programming since I was a kid. I have the longest and
closest relationship with the Javascript programming language, having worked
with it since the mid 90's. Based on my mastery of it's C-style syntax and
experience with application development, I quickly picked up programming Java
and C#, and soon became aware of more rigorous ways to go about solving problems
than are typically associated with Javascript.

At the same time as I like to be conscious of design patterns and algorithms, my
roots as something of a 'cowboy coder' mean that I can get things done and think
outside of the proverbial box.

While I'm versed in many of the latest frameworks and libraries like React,
React-Redux, and Redux-Sagas, I don't use the latest and greatest just
because it's cool. That's not me. I evolve existing legacy systems into the future, and
I want to use the right tool for the job. Sometimes that means building out your own tooling,
embracing functional programming, meta-programming, and more.

## Code

### GitHub

[github](https://go.jonathancook.site/github-repos)

View all my repos and the repos I've forked.

### Demo Projects

[deck-of-cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-demo))

An ES6 implementation of a deck of playing cards, including mix-ins, base
classes, and more.  In addition to implementing a standard deck of playing
cards, the code is extensible and can be used as the basis of any kind of card
deck.

As this is base code which doesn't include any implementation using the classes
the demo site shows information for various project metrics such as code
coverage and complete report of test results.  The test results reporting is
done using React components.

[React Deck-of-Cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-deck-of-cards-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-deck-of-cards-demo))

A React UI using CSS3 Flexbox, showing an implementation of shuffling and
dealing using the
[deck-of-cards](https://go.jonathancook.site/deck-of-cards-repo) code.  Also
allows for changing the card face design between the English pattern and a
Russian "Atlas" design.

[React ACID Trail](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-acid-trail-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/react-acid-trail-demo))
  
An ACID Trail is a sequence of colors and/or color names which is generated from
arbitrary data and can serve as a unique identifier for that data, and especially
a particular version of that data.  Distinguishing between different versions of
resources (e.g. files, records) which have the same "base" identifier is a difficult
problem.  I attempt to address this problem by using colors which are not randomly
generated but rather generated as a representation of the data to create.  Identical
versions of the same resource would have the same ACID Trail identifier.

This implementation utilizes ES6 and WebWorkers for the logic and code structure,
and React/Redux and Bootstrap for UI.

A (much) earlier version without ES6, WebWorkers, React, etc. is also linked below.

### Libraries/Tools

[Ångsturm](https://go.jonathancook.site/angsturm-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/angsturm-demo))

An application / toolkit extending AngularJS by introducing composite multi-aspect components.
Composition occurs along many lines including heirarchy, layout, component
definition, component configuration, component behavior, and contract/data
consumption.

It is presented in the form of an example application,
the [Interface Designer](https://go.jonathancook.site/angsturm).
To get to know how the toolkit works, you will need to examine the example
application code's configurations and data along with the angsturm.js code
itself.

[acid-trail](https://go.jonathancook.site/acid-trail-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/acid-trail-demo))

Early version of a utility to create a memorable / human readable identifier for an object /
document / state by mapping hashes to color sequences. Integrating existing
functionality from other tools to solve a new and unique problem. Easily
translates to other languages, I have implemented the code in C# as well as the
javascript shown here.

#### Plugin / Toy

[tower-egg](https://go.jonathancook.site/tower-egg-repo)
  ([demo](https://go.jonathancook.site/tower-egg-demo))

A small javascript puzzle game which implements the 'tower of hanoi' also known
as 'lucas tower'. Designed so it can be embedded easily as an application easter
egg :)

#### HTML5 Shim

[web worker shim](https://go.jonathancook.site/web-worker-shim-repo)
  (defunct)

Before the announcement of Chrome Frame, I was working on a shim for HTML5 Web
Worker API based off of Google Gears. After the announcement I mothballed the
project. It still stands as an example of my 'raw' JS programming.

## Past Work

## Sites

### Prototypes

[Collectist: The Walking Dead](https://go.jonathancook.site/thewalkingdead-collectist-org) and
  [Collectist: Gogos Crazy Bones](https://go.jonathancook.site/gogos-collectist-org)

Two sites running off of the same code engine — collectors maintain a checklist
for the particular hobby (obviously I have started with toys) which is stored
for them via localStorage. The code leverages require, knockback (knockout +
backbone), and a little bit of zurb foundation.

When completed, the site would enable different types of checklists such as
'have', 'want', 'will sell', 'will trade', etc. as well as sharing collections
with others via links. I would like to implement distributed (i.e. via Dropbox,
Google Drive, etc.) as well as centralized storage options (via document store
such as MongoDB); also distributed (i.e. OAuth, OpenID) and centralized
authentication.

### The Past

[Simpsons Collector Sector](https://go.jonathancook.site/simpsons-collectors)

A site built around and for the community of the Simpsons Collector Sector
message board. The site served as the primary hub for information and
socializing around the Playmates' 'World of Springfield' line of Simpsons toys
that were produced from 2000-2004.

While the language (VBScript/Classic ASP) and the coding is well below my
current standards, it still represents the implementation of a large hand-rolled
application with important features like image manipulation, CMS, blog, user
management, etc.

<!--
[GEKE.NET](https://go.jonathancook.site/geke-net)

Also very old, a site which contains portfolio sections for design and
programming that make me cringe a bit. This site hosts lots of code I wrote for
users of EzBoard (now Yuku), and
[an older page linking to code demos and source](https://go.jonathancook.site/geke-net-demos).

This code is good to look at if you're interested in my skills in programming JS
/ DHTML without frameworks as most of the code is made from scratch.
